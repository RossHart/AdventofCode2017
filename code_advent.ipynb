    "The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. \"The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!\" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. \"We have a big problem,\" she says; \"there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--\" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.\n",

    "The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.\n",

In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks.

    "### Part Two \n",
    "\n",
    "The logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n",

    "Here, you encounter a pair of dueling generators. The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\n",

    "The generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647. That final remainder is the value it produces next.\n",

    "You discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled simply \"Duet\". Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code yourself. Unfortunately, you don't see any documentation, so you're left to figure out what the instructions mean on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the assembly is meant to operate on a set of registers that are each named with a single letter and that can each hold a single integer. You suppose each register should start with a value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't that many instructions, so it shouldn't be hard to figure out what they do. Here's what you determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- snd X plays a sound with a frequency equal to the value of X.\n",
    "- set X Y sets register X to the value of Y.\n",
    "- add X Y increases register X by the value of Y.\n",
    "- mul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value contained in register X by the value of Y.\n",
    "- mod X Y sets register X to the remainder of dividing the value contained in register X by the value of Y (that is, it sets X to the result of X modulo Y).\n",
    "- rcv X recovers the frequency of the last sound played, but only when the value of X is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does nothing.)\n",
    "- jgz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is greater than zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the instructions can take either a register (a single letter) or a number. The value of a register is the integer it contains; the value of a number is that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each jump instruction, the program continues with the instruction to which the jump jumped. After any other instruction, the program continues with the next instruction. Continuing (or jumping) off either end of the program terminates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    set a 1\n",
    "    add a 2\n",
    "    mul a a\n",
    "    mod a 5\n",

    "    set a 0\n",
    "    rcv a\n",
    "    jgz a -1\n",
    "    set a 1\n",
    "    jgz a -2\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first four instructions set a to 1, add 2 to it, square it, and then set it to itself modulo 5, resulting in a value of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a sound with frequency 4 (the value of a) is played.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, a is set to 0, causing the subsequent rcv and jgz instructions to both be skipped (rcv because a is 0, and jgz because a is not greater than 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a is set to 1, causing the next jgz instruction to activate, jumping back two instructions to another jump, which jumps again to the rcv, which ultimately triggers the recover operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time the recover operation is executed, the frequency of the last sound played is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the value of the recovered frequency (the value of the most recently played sound) the first time a rcv instruction is executed with a non-zero value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your puzzle answer was 7071.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Two \n",
    "\n",
    "As you congratulate yourself for a job well done, you notice that the documentation has been on the back of the tablet this entire time. While you actually got most of the instructions correct, there are a few key differences. This assembly code isn't about sound at all - it's meant to be run twice at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run at the same speed. To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv) instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "snd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in a queue until that program is ready to receive them. Each program has its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it sent.\n",
    "rcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.\n",
    "Each program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1); the register p should begin with this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    snd 1\n",
    "    snd 2\n",
    "    snd p\n",
    "    rcv a\n",
    "    rcv b\n",
    "    rcv c\n",
    "    rcv d\n",
    "    \n",
    "Both programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b, and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0 receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees a different value in its own copy of register c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, both programs try to rcv a fourth time, but no data is waiting for either of them, and they reach a deadlock. When this happens, both programs terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that it would be equally valid for the programs to run at different speeds; for example, program 0 might have sent all three values and then stopped at the first rcv before program 1 executed even its first instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once both of your programs have terminated (regardless of what caused them to do so), how many times did program 1 send a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your puzzle answer was 8001.\n",
